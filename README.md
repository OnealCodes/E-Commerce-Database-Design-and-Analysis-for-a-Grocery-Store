In this e-commerce business, Peacock Margaret emerged as the top-performing employee, setting a high standard for customer satisfaction and sales. Berglunds snabbköp proved to be a loyal customer, making multiple purchases and highlighting the potential for a successful loyalty program.

Dairy Products topped the sales charts, supported by reliable supplier Pavlova Ltd. and efficient shipper United Package. However, a drop in orders in 2023 was noticed, indicating the need to investigate and address customer retention issues.

The product range is diverse, with Confections, Beverages, and Condiments leading in unique offerings. Blondel père stands out as a high-value customer, significantly contributing to the revenue.

Top-selling items like Chang, Chais, and Chef Anton’s Cajun Seasoning drive most of the sales, suggesting a focus on these products in marketing efforts. While the transaction success rate is high at 81.32%, there's room for improvement to enhance customer experience.

Lastly, monthly transaction trends show peaks in November and February, a plan for  promotions and inventory management should be made around these periods.

By recognizing top employees, fostering customer loyalty, and leveraging these insights, we can drive growth and improve overall performance.
