# E-Commerce-Database-Design-and-Analysis-for-a-Grocery-Store

Project Title: "E-Commerce Database Design and Analysis for a Grocery Store"
Project Description:
Your task is to design and implement a database for an imaginary grocery store. The database should capture and organize various aspects of the store's operations, such as product inventory, customer information, orders, and sales data. Additionally, you will analyze the data and provide insights to support business decision-making.
Goals
Provide the business insights of the E-Commerce performance from 2021–2022.
Result
The insight into the E-Commerce performance is shown in the dashboard report (USING POWER BI).
Project Steps:
1. Database Design:
• Identify the entities/tables and attributes/columns relevant to the fashion store (products, customers, orders, shippers, order details, categories, employee, suppliers)
• Design an appropriate database schema using a relational model, considering
relationships, primary and foreign keys.
2. Data Collection and Loading:
• Load the data into the database using a suitable database management system
(data will be provided for importation).
3. Data Analysis:
• Explore the data to gain insights into the store's operations. Consider
performing queries, aggregations, and statistical analysis to uncover trends,
patterns, and key metrics.
• Analyze sales data to identify popular products, customer purchasing
behaviors, seasonal trends, etc.
4. Business Insights:
• Based on the data analysis, extract meaningful insights and create
visualizations to present the findings.
• Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that are relevant to the fashion
store (e.g., sales revenue, customer retention rate, inventory turnover) and
track them over time.
• Create visualizations, charts, and graphs to present the findings effectively.
• Provide recommendations to improve business operations and decision making based on the insights derived from the data.
• Presentation and Documentation:
• Prepare a report summarizing the database design, data analysis process, and
the insights gained.
This project will provide you hands-on experience in designing and implementing a database for an e-commerce store. It will also allow you to analyze real world data, extract insights, and present their findings to demonstrate their understanding of data science principles.
